# Renegade BBS

This image runs a telnettable Renegade BBS server inside Docker.

![Renegade image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgoerzen/docker-bbs-renegade/master/renegade-login.png)

It is based upon:

 - [My DOSEMU environment for Docker](https://github.com/jgoerzen/docker-dosemu)
 - [My general BBS template, jgoerzen/dos-bbs](https://github.com/jgoerzen/docker-dos-bbs) and the dos-bbs-balance
 - [The Renegade BBS](http://renegadebbs.info)

This provides the full v1.20 setup in Drive G:.

# Install and Run

You can install with:

    docker pull jgoerzen/bbs-renegade

And run with:

    docker run -d -p 5901:5901 -p 23:23 --name bbs-renegade jgoerzen/bbs-renegade

# Accessing and general commands

For details, see the [dos-bbs generic info](https://github.com/jgoerzen/docker-dos-bbs).

# Installed Files

This image is built upon the extensive [collection in jgoerzen/dos-bbs](https://github.com/jgoerzen/docker-dos-bbs).
Please see that page for details on DOS and the underlying configuration.

Renegade itself is installed in `G:\RG`.

See the jgoerzen/dos-bbs documentation for more.

# VNC console and telnet ports

The jgoerzen/dos-bbs will describe this.  Please refer to it.

The node basically does this to start up a Renegade instance:

    h:
    cd ADF
    lh adf COM1 3F8  4 115200 8192  8192  8   (load the FOSSIL driver)
    g:
    cd rg
    renegade -N3 -Q -B115200   (where 3 is the node number)

You can start up the DOS console with `dosconsole`.  To access the Renegade
config system, run the above commands, except at the end, omit the `-Q -B115200`.

You can connect to the local BBS with ATDTlocalhost.
